# In Icarus's Defense

We tell the Icarus story wrong. We've been telling it wrong for three thousand years, actually, and I think it's done real damage.

I remember the first time I heard the myth. I must've been eight, maybe nine. Some illustrated book of Greek legends, the kind with painted pictures that made everything look dramatic and slightly terrifying. There was Icarus, tumbling through the sky, feathers scattering, his father reaching back in horror.

And I remember thinking, even then as a kid who definitely should've absorbed the "listen to your parents" message—*"but he was flying. He was actually flying. How was he supposed to just... not?"*

The teacher told us the moral. Hubris. Pride before the fall. Don't reach beyond your station. Know your limits.

I nodded along like everyone else. But something about it never sat right with me.

You know how the story goes: a foolish boy doesn't listen to his father, flies too close to the sun, wax melts, the boy falls, the boy dies. The end.

Moral of the story? Listen to your elders. Don't be arrogant. Know your place.

But here's what's always bothered me, if I'm being honest.

Icarus had spent his *entire life* in a labyrinth. Think about that for a second. Not a weekend, not a rough year—his whole existence—between stone walls and dead ends. The same corridors over and over.

That was his normal. That was all he knew of the world.

And then one day, his father straps wings to his back and says *fly*. But also: not too high, not too low, stay in the middle, follow me, be careful, be moderate, be safe.

And Icarus pushes off the ground. The air holds him. And suddenly, he's not trapped anymore. He's not walking someone else's maze.

The horizon isn't a wall. The sun is right there, this blazing impossible thing, and his wings are *working*, and for the first time in his life he is free.

I mean. What exactly did we expect him to do? Stay in the middle?

---

I think about this more than I probably should. There have been moments in my life—not dramatic, Greek-tragedy moments, just regular human ones—where I've felt the pull of something I knew was risky. Something everyone around me said was too much. Too ambitious. Too unlikely.

"Be realistic," they said. "Be practical." And I'd think of Icarus, and I'd wonder why we made him the villain of his own story.

Because here's the thing I've never been able to shake: if I'd been trapped in that labyrinth my whole life, and someone handed me wings, and I finally felt what it was like to rise... I don't know that I could've stayed in the middle either. I really don't.

I'm not saying I'm brave. I'm not saying I haven't played it safe more times than I'd like to admit. But in my gut, in the part of me that still feels things before my brain catches up with reasons to be careful, I understand Icarus. I've *always* understood him.

Daedalus, Icarus' father, was a genius. Legendary inventor. The man built the labyrinth in the first place—built it so well that he couldn't even escape his own creation. And when he finally engineered a way out, he envisioned flight the way a prisoner would. Simply for survival. As the most efficient route from point A to point B without dying.

He never once considered that his son might want to *feel* something. That flying might be more than transportation. That the sun might look, from up there, like it was worth reaching for.

Daedalus built wings that couldn't survive joy. That's a real engineering failure.

And look, I get it. I do.

The cautious path is the smart path. The middle road is where you don't drown and don't burn. There's wisdom in moderation, in listening, in heeding the warnings of people who've been around longer than you have. I'm not saying there isn't.

But I also think about all the times I've been handed a set of constraints and told they were for my own good.

All the times I've heard "be realistic" when what people meant was "be smaller."

All the times I've watched someone's eyes go dim when they finally stopped reaching for the thing they actually wanted because everyone around them said it was foolish, reckless, too much.

I've felt that dimming in myself. That slow, quiet surrender. And every time, there's this voice in the back of my head that sounds a lot like that kid looking at a picture of a falling boy.

We do this to each other constantly. We do it to kids especially. Dream big, we say, but not *that* big. Aim high, but not *so* high. Be yourself—but, you know, a more acceptable version.

And then we wonder why so many people feel like they're living in a prison. Going through the motions. Following the prescribed path. Safe, moderate, careful. Alive, technically. But not really living.

I've spent a lot of years in various versions of the labyrinth. We all have, I think.

The job that pays the bills but empties something out of you.

The relationship that's fine, just fine, nothing more.

The version of your life that looks right on paper but feels like walking the same corridors over and over, waiting for something to change.

And sometimes, not always, but sometimes, I've caught a glimpse of the sun.

Some wild idea. Some terrifying possibility. Some version of my life that felt so big and unlikely that my first instinct was to look away.

Every time, there were voices. Some external, some internal. *"Be careful. Be moderate. Stay in the middle. That's not for people like you."*

And every single time, I've had to decide: Am I Daedalus, or am I Icarus?

I haven't always chosen the sun. I wish I could tell you I had. But when I have, when I've actually gone for the thing that scared me, the thing that everyone said was too much, I've never regretted it.

Even when it didn't work out. Even when, in some ways, I fell and burnt.

Because falling while reaching for something real is different from walking safely through a maze forever.

It just is. I can't explain it better than that.

The real tragedy of Icarus isn't that he aimed too high. It's that we've spent three millennia using his story to teach people to aim lower. To stay in the middle. To fear their own yearning like it's something dangerous, something that needs to be managed and contained.

Longing *is* dangerous. That's sort of the point. The things worth wanting are usually the things that can break you. Love is like that. Art is like that. Any dream that actually matters is like that.

To be human is to be handed a life full of limits and to strain against them anyway. Not because we're stupid. Not because we don't understand the risks. But because something in us, something old, inarticulate and stubbornly alive, knows that the unlived life isn't worth protecting.

That staying in the middle isn't really safety at all. It's just a slower kind of falling.

Icarus fell. I'm not pretending he didn't. The sea swallowed him whole.

But for one moment—one single, blazing moment—he was closer to the sun than anyone had ever been. He felt the full heat of it on his face. He knew what it was like to reach and touch the edge of the impossible.

That was the point. That was always the point.

Maybe Daedalus made it to Sicily. Maybe he lived a long, careful, moderate life.

Maybe he built more clever things and earned more praise and died peacefully in his sleep.

But nobody tells his story.

We remember the boy who flew too high. We remember him because somewhere, deep down, we understand. We've all felt the sun up there, pulling at something inside us. We've all had to choose between the middle path and the thing that's calling our name.

Icarus chose the sun.

And honestly? After a lifetime in the labyrinth?

I'm not sure I blame him. I think, given the same wings, I might have done the same thing.

So here's what I want to say, if you're still reading. If you're someone with a dream that feels too big, a vision that makes people uncomfortable, an ambition that others call unrealistic.

**Go.**

I mean it. *Go.*

Not recklessly. Build the best wings you can. Learn everything there is to learn. Work harder than anyone says you need to. But don't let the fear of falling keep you in the middle. Don't let the cautious voices—the ones outside you and the ones inside—convince you to stay small because small is safer.

It isn't. Not really.

Safe and small just means you get to watch the sun from a distance for the rest of your life, always wondering what it would've felt like to get close.

The labyrinth will always be there, offering its winding, predictable paths.

There will always be people who've made peace with the walls of their prison, who'll tell you to be realistic, to manage your expectations, to want less. They're not bad people. They're just scared. We're all scared.

But you have wings. Maybe they're fragile. Maybe they're imperfect. Maybe everyone's telling you they'll melt.

**Fly anyway.**

Fly toward the thing that calls to you, the thing that burns, the thing that might break you but might also be the realest thing you ever do.

Because the alternative—the moderate, middle path—isn't really living.

And if you fall? Then you fall, having reached for something. You fall knowing what the sun looked like up close. You fall with the memory of what it felt like to actually, fully, terrifyingly *try*.

That's more than most people will ever get in their lifetime.

Icarus succeeded in the only way that mattered.

He reached for the thing that called to him, and even if for one brilliant brief moment, he touched the edges of the impossible.

The fall was just the price.

And some things—the real things, the beautiful things, the things that make you feel alive—are worth every bit of it.

So go. Fly. Reach.

*Your sun is waiting.*
